# Kirby Webhooks

This plugin provides a panel field for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/). Use it to easily trigger [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) from the Kirby panel.

Probably the most common use for a webhook would be to trigger a build or deploy mechanism.

## Docs

If you want to quickly set up a deploy hook, check the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/pju-/kirby-webhooks/tree/master/docs/quickstart.md).
